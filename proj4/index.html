      <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
      <p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>
      <p style="color: blue;">In this project, we implemented cloth physics and simulation with collision detection and the following shaders: Blinn-Phong shading, bump mapping, displacement mapping, texture mappng, and mirror mapping using a precomputed environment map. The cloth structure was implemented by using springs. Cloth simulation was implemented by calculating the force acting on the springs and using Verlet integration to compute the new positions. Collision detection was implemented by calculating if any objects intersected each other and applying a slight force if they did to keep them from intersecting. Shader programs were implemented by using GLSL to calculate the lighting and color using object and lighting information. We thought it was interesting how different implementations of shaders could drastically affect the renders of the same scene.</p>

      <h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>

      <p><b>Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs. Show us what the wireframe looks like (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints.</b></p>

      <p><b>Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R.
Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?  What about for density?  What about for damping?  For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.</b></p>

          <li>When ks = 50000, the cloth has the least wrinkles and falls slower because the cloth is the stiffest and doesn't stretch as much.</li>
          <li>When density = 1, the cloth has the least wrinkles when it folds on itself because the cloth is the lightest, resulting in less self-collisions.</li>

      <h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>
      <p>Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.</p>
      <p style="color: blue;">
        A shader program is a program defined by GLSL, OpenGL's Shading Language, which is designed to run on a GPU. They provide code to calculate lighting, shadows, and color when rendering 3D scenes. There are different stages of the rendering pipeline that shader programs can affect. Two of these stages include vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders processes individual vertices and apply transformations to them. Fragment shaders processes fragments generated by rasterization into colors and depth values. They work together to create lighting and material effects because fragment shaders take the output of vertex shaders to produce color.</p>

      <p>Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</p>

      </div>
      <p style="color: blue;">The Blinn-Phong shading model is a shader model that accounts for ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, producing realistic renderings of lighting on objects. The Blinn-Phong model differs from the Phong model because it uses the halfway vector between the light source direction and the viewing direction.</p>

      <p style="color: blue;">The difference between bump mapping and displacment mapping is that displacement mapping physically changes the position of the vertices while bump mapping only modifies the surface normals.

      <p style="color: blue;">The main difference between bump and displacement mapping is that the spheres are slightly bigger in displacement mapping because it modifies the position of the vertices. When the resolution of the sphere is higher, the sphere becomes smoother and more round, especially its edges.</p>
